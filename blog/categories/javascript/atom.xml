    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/17k3QJq.jpg?1" alt="Challenge" /></p>

<p>After applying to a few startups on Angellist, I was super excited to have gotten through my very first phone interview. At the end of the call, the HR rep scheduled me for a technical challenge. He said I would have up to 24 hours to complete the challenge, but that I&rsquo;d have to check in at the 2 hour mark and report my progress. I would be assessed on both the first draft of my code at the 2 hour mark, and the final version.</p>

<p>The task was pretty straightforward: to create a game in the language I felt most comfortable in. Since I applied for a backend position, I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to create any front-end or accept any user input. The program was supposed to simulate the turns taken by players and have a function to print out the board in ASCII.</p>

<p>Now.. this was a pretty challenging task for me. I got the basic version down, but it took me about 4 hours to complete and another hour of debugging before I felt comfortable enough to submit the final version. Here&rsquo;s what I learned from the whole process:</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t freak out!</h2>

<p>Once I got the challenge emailed to me, I set an alarm for 2 hours. While this helped me keep track of my time, it also made me really anxious as I saw the minutes slipping by. I would have gotten further along much faster if I didn&rsquo;t obsessively check the time every five minutes.</p>

<h2>Find a quiet place to work</h2>

<p>When living in a house with 20 other people, it&rsquo;s hard to find a quiet place to think, let alone code. My advice is: either lock yourself in your room and ask your roommates not to bother you, or get out of the house for a few hours. I ended up on a park bench for my last- and most productive- hour.</p>

<h2>Hit MVP before trying to get fancy</h2>

<p>Everyone always says to hit MVP first before trying anything fancy, even if your MVP is the most obnoxious piece of code you&rsquo;ve ever written. Now I know why I keep hearing this- it&rsquo;s the best piece of advice out there. Get <strong>something</strong> working and then revise if you have any time left. If not.. you won&rsquo;t have anything working to show for all of your hard work. To reiterate: <strong>GET SOMETHING WORKING!</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take my own advice on this one, and I ended up wasting a lot of time trying to debug a function that just wasn&rsquo;t working. At my two hour check-in, I barely had any working code to show.</p>

<h2>If you don&rsquo;t have time..</h2>

<p>Sometimes there just isn&rsquo;t enough time to refactor. I submitted the final version of this challenge about 5:30 hours in. It isn&rsquo;t fancy- actually, it barely hits MVP- but it works.</p>

<p>I had a lot going on- I had another in-person interview to prepare for, I had to continue working on another piece of code that my team needed to present the next day, and I was just plain exhausted from coding so much.</p>

<h2>Are you sure you want to submit?</h2>

<p>The thing is- I probably could have created a more elegant solution if I had spent more time on it. That&rsquo;s the thing about coding: it&rsquo;s impossible not to improve. The more time you spend coding, the better you get, the smarter you become.</p>

<p>I did have the full 24 hours to finish the challenge, but I submitted at around the 6 hour mark. In hindsight, I should have slept on it for a few hours and woken up to work on it the next day with a fresh pair of eyes. I was afraid that taking all of the allotted time would reflect negatively on my abilities, but you know what- I think it&rsquo;s better to take more time to submit something you can be proud of than to submit the bare minimum and regret it all week.</p>

<h2>My solution</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not very proud of my code, nor am I happy with how far I got on this challenge, because I really did just barely get MVP. I don&rsquo;t expect this to land me the job I was going for. In fact, I will be suuuper surprised if I get any reply back from that HR guy, but that&rsquo;s part of the reason I&rsquo;m posting this now.</p>

<h2>This is honestly the skill level I&rsquo;m at right now</h2>

<p>This is how I code. This is truly a reflection of where I&rsquo;m at. Sometimes it takes me forever to get anywhere (like it did with this challenge). Sometimes it takes me minutes. That&rsquo;s how it is for us stone-cold beginners. But you know what&hellip; that&rsquo;s okay! I&rsquo;m getting there, and you&rsquo;ll get there too. With each new challenge we take on and refuse to give up on, we get better and better. We shave minutes off of our time. We&rsquo;re able to think more logically and efficiently. And most of all, we can feel proud of ourselves because we really did try our hardest.. and we didn&rsquo;t give up!</p>
