Integrating Jekyll with gh-pages shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. The idea is simple: you already have a personal website hosted on yourusername.github.io. The goal is to create a blog and host it on yourusername.github.io/blog. Sounds easy, right?!

Well, not so fast.. Jekyll and gh-pages are not the stellar, easy-going couple that they claim to be. Integrating the two- especially when you already have a static site at yourusername.github.io- is not such an easy task.

In comes Octopress! Octopress is a static blogging framework built on top of Jekyll. It's supposed to allow for easy integration and deployment. I was so excited when I found out it existed.. but then I started reading through it's documentation and my excitement fizzled out pretty quick.

# The goal

We know the goal- to get a blog up and running on gh-pages- specifically, gh project pages- since we already have a site at yourusername.github.io

# The steps

First, create a new repo on github.com called blog. This is where our octopress site will live. Copy the location (https://github.com/yourusername/blog.git).

In your terminal, navigate to the directory you want to create and edit your blog project in. In that directory, perform these commands:  

- git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git blog
- cd blog
- git init
- git add .
- git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/blog.git
- git commit -m "initializing octopress"
- git push origin master

You've just initialized your blog project with Octopress! Now let's set everything up:

- gem install bundler
- bundle install
- rake setup_github_pages

At this point, you'll be asked to give a repository url. Use the same url you copied from github (https://github.com/yourusername/blog.git)

- git	config branch.master.remote origin
- rake install
- rake generate
- rake deploy
- rake preview

Rake install will install the default Octopress theme on your site. Generate and deploy will get it running, and preview will allow you to preview your site locally at localhost:4000

To install a new theme, such as ioveracker's MNML, follow these steps:

- git clone git://github.com/ioveracker/mnml.git .themes/mnml
- rake install['mnml']
- rake generate
- rake deploy
- rake preview

# And that's how it's done

As always, don't forget to git add .&& git commit -m "updating site.." && git push -u origin master to save your changes on yourusername.github.io/blog!
